PRESENTATION FILE
=================
An bare example file including most used extensions is given in the current folder as "presentation-includedeck.html".
An older, more verbose version is also proposed as "presentation.html".
These files are independant of each others but they reference and use the files from the "deck.js" folder.
If you want to reduce the overall size of the "deck.js" folder, you can safely remove the "deck.js/samples" directory (if you don't need the samples obviously).



RESOURCES
=========
Example presentations can be found in the the deck.js/samples folder.
You can also consult online examples, see http://home.heeere.com/tech-deckjs-ext.html



NOTE FOR USE WITH CHROME/CHROMIUM
=================================
To allow the presentation page to load all the resources when stored locally, you must start chrome/chromium with a special command line option.
Use "chromium-browser --disable-web-security " to do so.
